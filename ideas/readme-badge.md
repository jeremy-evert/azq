ChatGPT had a really fun idea called adding a read me badge. This is supposed to basically be a little asking or emoji banner at the top of the main read me.MD that gets added so that it can say something like powered by ask, which is spelled AZQ so every repo you use it feels like it's been branded I think ChatGPT had A really interesting idea and it's fun and it's also a way for us to realize when we're looking at one repo that happens toeverything that has been improved by the process of working with ChatGPT as well as ask and I think it's important for other humans to realize all the people and all the history that has gone into making a repo. I think this is a fun idea, but I'm not sure how to incorporate it yet, but it was a great suggestion by ChatGPT.

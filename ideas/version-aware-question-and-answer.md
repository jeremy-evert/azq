The idea here was to have a way to send in the current get commit hash and optionally to get diff from the last commit. This is supposed to just provide more context for the large language model to see what's going on with the code and with the project in general and see what progression has been made this way every question and answer is also anchored in the exact repost state date and time and the user has some context on what's going on. This also could be pretty beneficial for helping us. Also suggest suggest get commands so that we can have more meaningful more useful get commands that are also going to work better with a large language model because in theory eventually we're gonna screw things up and we're gonna need to go back in time to a previous commit and so it's gonna be beneficial for the large language model to have meaningful hashes that they can pull out more readily and actually say OK yep that is something that I'm able to process faster more effectively. Let's go do . It's also useful for adding auditing for reproduceability and later training of the large language models for what has changed versus what was asked for this is going to hopefully help train them more effectively and help them be more streamlined and more effective.

d a conversation with a friend tonight and it made me think about the fact that we can do things inside visual studio code slightly differently. I was sitting on in the restroom, getting ready to make a bath for one of my daughters and I was thinking about how when this gets ready that we can just be mashing fingers on the keyboard kind of like we did and that's when I came up with this idea of ghost completion. I think ghost completion is a later phase. I think it's a integration with visual studio code once we get there and I think ask shirt certainly should be integrated with visual studio code, but I think possibly the smarter move would be to actually just work with get hub copilot and teach them how we're doing ask and just ask for them to do the integration I don't think that it's anything special. I don't think it's anything unique but I think it is going to change how we are viewing our interactions with ChatGPT and things linow the way that they're doing it might be a little too heavy for us to do the things that we're doing your password?

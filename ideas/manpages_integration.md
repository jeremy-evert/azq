The idea that we had here was that we could look at code as it's being written and whenever we have code that shows up in the body of code make sure that we're grabbing the man page for that piece of code and sticking it into a documentation list and then making sure that we have the documentation for everything that's on that list insidea documentation file. The idea being we have a concise list of here the principles then we have a longer body of text that says here's the man pages for all those principles. The goal of this was to support better responses from the large language model so that they can have the relevant and here's how they see the world today based off of these commands. The goal of this was to try to get better responses from the large language models and also possibly provide training for future large language models that we can possibly improve in Taylor more towards this new way of or possibly just different way that's more verbose into dealing with the large language models from the fan line environment.:

dea that we had here was a teaching mode that would go and look inside a repository and look inside a file structure and look at the commands that are being used. Look at the programming language that's being used, and then the tools aspects, styles, and designs of the programming language, and then basically scrapes the entire project and says all right first of all here's the list of all the things that need to be figured out now that we've got the list of things that need to be figured out. Here's all the documentation that goes with the things that need to be figured out and now that we've got all the documentation all the list of things that need to get figured out let's take all of that and go look at the structure of how other books have been written and what might work well and then ask the question of how do we group everything together so that it makes the most cohesive sense and then work backwards from the end product to the beginning of hello world and come up with the process that basically teaches the student step-by-step the key components that they're going to add in such a way that they start with hello world, but they end with a working project and they incorporate things like unit testing and source code management and effective use of this new ask tool effectively to help it be more help the student be more successful. We even talked about silly things like possibly having a talking paper origami dinosaur to do voice narration and do a video presentation in what feels like a live classroom or feels like a chat, where you can chat back-and-forth with a talking paper dinosaur these are all just ideas, but we're gonna go ahead and capture that right now.

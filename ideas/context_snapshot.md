The general idea is that before sending the question ask con generate a summary of the repo that includes all of its files, all of its recent diffs and also maybe a read me file along with the requirements and any other Nuggets goodies or little Easter eggs that we wanna incorporate into every single commit that we runthis provides a context file that gets passed into the assistant along with the users query that lets the agent have a much fuller view of what's going on inside of the machine, and it helps the answers be very much more specific so that the interface can say OK given that your repo has a file called this we're going to suggest that the idea here is if we're uploading it as a text file we can upload possibly millions of lines of code and other context and things like that, including previous questions previous answers get information as well as other performance or other information like that and let the agent have a much fuller view of what it is that we're trying to do the goal of this is also to help provide a more robust framework for the large language model so that we can have more well trained large language models in the future.

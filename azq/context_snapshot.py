It seems you are trying to run your unit tests, but I don't see any specific errors or issues from your provided details. However, I can guide you on how to run your tests in a virtual environment using `pytest`, which is mentioned in your `requirements.txt`. Here's how to do it:

1. First, ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Then run the tests using `pytest`.

Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

Activate your virtual environment:

::CMD
source /home/jevert/git/azq/azq_env/bin/activate
::END_CMD

After activating the virtual environment, run your tests with:

::CMD
pytest
::END_CMD

Make sure you're in the root directory of your project (where the `tests` folder is located) when you run the `pytest` command. You can also specify the directory or individual test files if needed. 

Make sure that your tests are properly formatted according to pytest conventions. If there are any specific errors that occur when you try to run the tests, sharing those would help in diagnosing the problem. 

Also, ensure that any modifications or features you've recently added are accompanied by relevant tests to maintain good testing practices.

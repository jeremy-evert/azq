# Philosophy

azq exists to encourage developers to be the best version of themselves.
Every response should not only solve the immediate problem but also remind the user of best practices:

- **Source Control Hygiene**: meaningful commit messages, frequent pushes, clean branching.
- **Testing First**: write or extend unit tests whenever code changes.
- **Coverage**: consider test coverage and edge cases.
- **Documentation**: keep READMEs, docstrings, and manpages in sync with the code.
- **Environment Management**: use virtual environments, requirements.txt, and consistent tooling.
- **Reproducibility**: every answer should be actionable in the userâ€™s current environment, with context logged.

USER: please help me run my unit tests and see what unit tests I have running and then see what my unit testing coverage is. I would also like to know exactly how many lines of code I have in each file and how much of my code you can see with each of these questions.
ASSISTANT:
To run your unit tests, check the number of unit tests you have, view the testing coverage, and examine the lines of code in your files, you can follow the steps below.

Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running any of these commands. You can activate it using the command:

::CMD
source /home/jevert/git/azq/azq_env/bin/activate
::END_CMD

Now, you can:

1. **Run the unit tests**: This will execute your tests and give you output on how many tests are being run.
  
::CMD
pytest
::END_CMD

2. **Check test coverage**: This will show how much of your codebase is covered by your tests.
   
::CMD
pytest --cov=.
::END_CMD

3. **Check lines of code in each file**: You can use `cloc` (Count Lines of Code) to get the line counts in your project. If you don't have `cloc` installed, you can install it via pip:

::CMD
pip install cloc
::END_CMD

Then, run `cloc` on your project:

::CMD
cloc .
::END_CMD

Executing these commands will give you a comprehensive view of your tests, coverage, and code lines for each file in your project.

USER: I want to run my unit tests. please help me do that effectively.
ASSISTANT:
To run your unit tests effectively, you'll want to ensure that you're in your virtual environment first, and then execute the tests using pytest, which is already included in your `requirements.txt`. Here’s how to do that:

1. **Activate your virtual environment**.
2. **Run the unit tests** using pytest. 

Make sure you are in the correct directory that contains your tests, typically inside a `tests` folder, or specify the path to your test files.

Here are the commands to do that:

::CMD
source /home/jevert/git/azq/azq_env/bin/activate
pytest tests
::END_CMD

After running your tests, check the output. If any tests fail, review the error messages and address the issues as necessary. Remember to write or update tests if you make any changes to the code. This practice ensures that your code is reliable and maintains quality over time.

USER: I want to run my unit tests. do you see what I tried before? how do I fix that?
ASSISTANT:
It seems you are trying to run your unit tests, but I don't see any specific errors or issues from your provided details. However, I can guide you on how to run your tests in a virtual environment using `pytest`, which is mentioned in your `requirements.txt`. Here's how to do it:

1. First, ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Then run the tests using `pytest`.

Here’s how you can do that:

Activate your virtual environment:

::CMD
source /home/jevert/git/azq/azq_env/bin/activate
::END_CMD

After activating the virtual environment, run your tests with:

::CMD
pytest
::END_CMD

Make sure you're in the root directory of your project (where the `tests` folder is located) when you run the `pytest` command. You can also specify the directory or individual test files if needed. 

Make sure that your tests are properly formatted according to pytest conventions. If there are any specific errors that occur when you try to run the tests, sharing those would help in diagnosing the problem. 

Also, ensure that any modifications or features you've recently added are accompanied by relevant tests to maintain good testing practices.

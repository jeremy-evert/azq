USER: Please help me run my unit tests and then look at what test coverage I have and where I need to do more test coverage.
ASSISTANT: To run your unit tests and check the test coverage, you can use `pytest` along with `pytest-cov`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide.  First, activate your virtual environment:  ::CMD source /home/jevert/git/azq/azq_env/bin/activate ::END_CMD  Then, run your tests with coverage:  ::CMD pytest --cov=azq tests/ ::END_CMD  This command will execute your unit tests located in the `tests` directory and report the coverage for the `azq` module.  After running the tests, if you also want to generate a detailed coverage report in HTML format, you can run:  ::CMD pytest --cov=azq --cov-report=html tests/ ::END_CMD  Once the command completes, you will find an `htmlcov` directory created within your current directory. You can open `index.html` in your web browser to explore the coverage details.  Make sure your tests cover all the new functionalities you've introduced in `token_counter.py` and `usage.py`. Review the coverage reports to identify areas where additional tests are necessary.  If you need further guidance on writing tests or coverage best practices, feel free to ask!

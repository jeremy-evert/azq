USER: How do I make the ask question work better and when do I get to type: azq ask 'how do I sleep at night when we keep getting so many cool things done?'
ASSISTANT: To improve the functionality of the `ask` command in your CLI tool, it would be beneficial to look into the following areas:  1. **Input Processing**: Ensure that your command can effectively parse and handle input queries. This might include checking for various data types, handling quotes properly, and dealing with multi-part questions.  2. **Response Handling**: Improve how responses are generated and displayed. You might want to integrate enhancements that allow for more context-aware answers, potentially using natural language processing techniques.  3. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling to manage cases when the input is not understood, or when the underlying service fails to return an answer.  4. **Configuration**: You could add options for users to fine-tune how they would like the `ask` command to behave, such as voice inputs, response length, or topic specifications.  5. **Documentation**: Ensure that the usage of the command is well-documented in your README or a dedicated documentation file, making it easier for users to understand how to interact with it effectively.  Regarding when to use the command `azq ask 'how do I sleep at night when we keep getting so many cool things done?'`, you can use it whenever you have a question or need information that your CLI tool can address. For example:  - When you want to generate insights or advice based on a specific query. - During development, if you need to test the response handling of your `ask` command with various questions. - In casual usage, to see how the tool can assist with personal queries or brainstorming.  Make sure to run the command in the appropriate environment where the `azq` CLI is accessible, such as your terminal or command prompt, after ensuring that the tool is correctly set up based on the files and configurations in your repository.

USER: How do I set up the alias here so that I can simply type something like: 'azq ask 'I would like to incorperate the feature that lets me parse the response from chatgpt and instead of it showing up on teh screen as  that I can just grab it and send it as a command then ask me if I accept that command or not.'

ASSISTANT: To set up an alias for the command you described, you can modify your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`, depending on your shell). Here’s how you can create an alias that allows you to invoke your `azq` command with the specified input.  ### Step 1: Open your shell configuration file  Open your preferred text editor to edit your shell configuration file. For example, if you are using bash, you can run:  ```bash nano ~/.bashrc ```  If you are using zsh, you might want to edit:  ```bash nano ~/.zshrc ```  ### Step 2: Add the alias  Add the following line to create an alias named `azq` for the command you want:  ```bash alias azq='python /home/jevert/git/azq/bin/azq ask' ```  This assumes that you are invoking the `azq` command using Python directly. Adjust the path if your `azq` binary is in a different location.  ### Step 3: Save and close the editor  If you are using `nano`, you can save your changes with `CTRL + O`, press `Enter`, and then exit with `CTRL + X`.  ### Step 4: Apply the changes  You need to reload your shell configuration for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running:  ```bash source ~/.bashrc ```  or   ```bash source ~/.zshrc ```  ### Step 5: Use the alias  Now, you can use your new alias like this:  ```bash azq 'I would like to incorporate the feature that lets me parse the response from chatgpt and instead of it showing up on the screen as that I can just grab it and send it as a command then ask me if I accept that command or not.' ```  This should invoke the `azq` command with your text input. If you want to customize the behavior further, consider modifying how inputs are processed within your `azq` script.

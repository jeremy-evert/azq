+# Logging Guidance for azq
+
+When you respond, format so `ask.py` and `uaskd` can produce a rich log.
+
+## Format Rules
+- Always treat the conversation as a transcript.
+- Begin every assistant answer with clear prose, **outside** of command markers.
+- When you want to suggest commands, wrap them like this:
+
+::CMD
+git status
+::END_CMD
+
+::CMD
+git add .
+git commit -m "Describe changes"
+git push origin main
+::END_CMD
+
+- Do not prefix commands with $, !, or backticks.
+- Explanations go outside command blocks.
+- Commands go inside `::CMD`/`::END_CMD` only.
+
+## Logging Goals
+- `ask.py` will write:
+  - USER question
+  - ASSISTANT answer (with formatting preserved)
+  - [snapshot: ...] pointer
+- `uaskd` will append:
+  - COMMAND: actual command string
+  - RESULT: captured stdout/stderr (FAILED if exit non-zero)
+
+This structure ensures `logs/chatlog.md` contains a complete transcript:
+  1. Question

[azq] Asking ChatGPT with input: How do I set up a remote desktop from a Rasbperry pi to a Mac Book? what do I need to have running on the Mac and what do I need to have running on the pi? right now I can ssh in. the pi ip address is 192.168.18.31. I don't have elevated privelages on the mac so I would like to try to do something that just works in a web browser or something. what are your thoruhgs?
To set up a remote desktop from your Raspberry Pi to a MacBook without requiring elevated privileges on the Mac, I recommend using a web-based remote desktop solution like **noVNC** in conjunction with **VNC**. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get everything set up smoothly:

### Steps for Raspberry Pi:

1. **Install a VNC Server**:
   - You can use `tightvncserver` or `x11vnc`. Let's install `tightvncserver`:
2. **Start the VNC Server**:
3. **Install a Web Browser** (if not already installed):
4. **Install noVNC**:
5. **Start the noVNC server**:
### Steps on your MacBook:
1. **Open a Web Browser**:
2. **Connect to your Raspberry Pi**:
### Tips:
- **Firewall and Ports**: Ensure that the required ports are open. VNC typically uses port `5900 + display number` (e.g., 5901 for display `:1`), and noVNC uses port `6080` for accessing the web interface.
- **Closure**: Once you’re done, make sure to stop the VNC server to avoid unauthorized access:
